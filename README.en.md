# E-graveyard of Dumchenko family

Read in other languages: [Русский](README.md), [English](README.en.md)

[This website on Github Pages](https://dumchenko.github.io/graveyard) allows us to tell stories about deceased members of our family.

QR-code with link to this website will be printed on tombstone instead of any photos so any physical graveyard visitor will be able not only to see just dates and old photo but videos with this person and who they were to us.

## Tiny history of this project

[I](https://github.com/r3nic1e) wished to commemorate my dad in out family way: simple, technological and effective. Thus instead of engraving my dad's photo on the tombstone the remaining part of our family decided to place there a separate plate with QR-code linking to e-graveyard with multiple photos and videos with my dad.

We are confident dad would be excited and proud of this because he had pushed me into IT with educational programming books when I had been 11. And he also worked with teletypes and programmed on perfocards so we make end of his life as technology-driven as he started it.
